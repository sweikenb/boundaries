# Content configuration
content:
  # Define the filename-patterns for which the proper file-contents will be loaded to be used in checks,
  # non-matching files will enter the checks with an empty string as $content.
  # Note that this can be a single string or an array of strings if you want to check for multiple patterns.
  only-for: "#\\.(php|twig|json|yaml|yml|xml)$#i"

# Paths to check
paths:

  # Define the directory you want to check relatively to the composer working-directory:
  src/Some/Directory:

    # Set a label for this directory in order to better organize your config and print better error messages
    label: "My example source directory"

    # Define your checks for this directory
    checks:

      # The checked file paths will be relativ to the configured directory without any prefix such as "./".
      # This allows for detailed patterns (e.g. ensuring the file starts with uppercase letters for example):
      files:
        - "#^([A-Z]+)(.+)\\.php#"

      # Content patterns will run the pattern-check against the whole content of each file in the configured directory.
      # You can use case-insensitive checks by providing the "i" modifier to the pattern:
      content-deny:
        - "#denied content php-regex pattern here#i"

      # The allow-pattern will whitelist files that where previously matched the deny-pattern.
      content-allow:
        - "#allowed content php-regex pattern here, which wins over any 'content-deny' pattern#i"
